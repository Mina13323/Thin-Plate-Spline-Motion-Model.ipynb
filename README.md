# 🌐 Thin Plate Spline Motion Model (TPS)

This project demonstrates how to implement and visualize the **Thin Plate Spline (TPS)** motion model — a smooth, non-linear deformation technique used in computer vision and deep learning tasks such as **face alignment**, **image animation**, and **motion transfer**.

## 🧠 What is TPS?

**Thin Plate Spline (TPS)** is a geometric transformation technique that models a smooth mapping between two sets of control points (keypoints). It is widely used in:

- Face and body landmark alignment
- Motion transfer (e.g., talking head synthesis)
- Image warping and style transfer
- Spatial transformer modules in neural networks

## 📓 About the Notebook

The `Thin_Plate_Spline_Motion_Model.ipynb` notebook walks you through:

- Defining source and destination keypoints  
- Computing the TPS transformation matrix  
- Applying the transformation to warp a source image  
- Visualizing warped grids and deformation effects

This implementation is self-contained and built with NumPy and SciPy, making it easy to understand and extend.

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
opencv-python

How It Works
Input a source image and keypoints.

Define the target keypoints (either by motion, offset, or another frame).

Compute TPS coefficients using radial basis functions.

Apply a warp grid to deform the original image.

Visualize both grid and warped results.

📸 Example Use Cases
Face Alignment: Match facial landmarks before GAN inference.

Pose Transfer: Apply TPS to map poses from one person to another.

Augmentation: Generate smooth distortions to improve training datasets.

🔍 Visualization
The notebook includes matplotlib plots of:

Original vs. warped image

🛠 Extensions
You can extend this project to:

Integrate with neural nets (e.g., STN modules)

Apply TPS to video sequences

Combine TPS with affine or perspective transformations
